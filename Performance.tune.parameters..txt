Tuning parameters. 
I. DataFrames versus SQL versus Datasets versus RDDs
Across all languages, DataFrames, Datasets, and SQL are equivalent in speed. 
This means that if you’re using DataFrames in any of these languages, performance is equal. 

Lastly, if you want to use RDDs, we definitely recommend using Scala or Java. 
If that’s not possible, we recommend that you restrict the “surface area” of RDDs in your application to the bare minimum. 
That’s because when Python runs RDD code, it’s serializes a lot of data to and from the Python process. 
This is very expensive to run over very big data and can also decrease stability.
