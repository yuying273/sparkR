#A better approach is to start from the pair RDD and then use the reduceByKey() transformation to create a new pair RDD. The reduceByKey() transformation gathers together pairs that have the same key and applies the function provided to two values at a time, iteratively reducing all of the values to a single value. reduceByKey() operates by applying the function first within each partition on a per-key basis and then across the partitions, allowing it to scale efficiently to large datasets.
